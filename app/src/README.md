# Intro To React 
*🎉🎈🎂🍾🎊🍻💃*

*A hands on and practical introduction
 to React development.*

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. With React, we are able to compose complex UIs from small and isolated blocks of code called "Components". A component is the equivalent of a jquery-ui style HTML "widget" that encompasses both functionality and aesthetic styling. Furthermore, a component is typically defined by a data scheme - usually stored as a "state" variable or passed along as a "prop" from another component. React is "declarative" in that we tell it what to do and worry less about "how" to do it.
