# Online Environments

There are a lot of tools available that allow us to write react code inside the browser. Using these tools, we can write react code that more closely resembles production code.

## [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/new)

Codesandbox is nice in that it allows us to create a "virtual" filesystem and write code as if React's build dependencies are already pre-installed. 

This tool is free and ready to use from the get-go and therefore is highly recommended for usage in building small react apps to understand the underlying principles governing this framework.
